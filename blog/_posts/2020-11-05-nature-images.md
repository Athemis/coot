My colleagues recent published a paper (Nakane et al. (2020) "Single Particle cryo-EM at atomic resolution") and asked
me to make a figure. I did so and it is this week's front cover image.

This was made with the "gtk3" branch of Coot.

Takanori himself made a front cover image too in PyMOL and seeing that I tried to make a version in a similar style using Coot.
I didn't copy it exactly, you can see that my version is not volumetric and is smoother and more gem-like.

The point of this image is to illustrate that the reconstruction provides good evidence for the position
of hydrogen atoms (which are the green blobs, of course).

This is intentionally large, to demonstrate the arbitrary framebuffer scaling.

You can see Takanori's version on twitter (he is [@biochem\_fan](https://twitter.com/biochem_fan))

The source code for "gtk3" Coot is updated/released every day or so, but
the binaries are not (that's too much of a time sink at the moment).
