Sai Li and co-workers (not least of whom is Max Crispin, a recent co-author of my own)
published "Molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus" in Cell today:

I downloaded the map from EMDB (30340) and made this image.

Yes, you can reproduce it if you wish. I ask (this is a request, not a
condition) that you acknowledge me and let me know (Paul Emsley @ MRC
LMB - search the Contacts).

Here a link to the full resolution version:

The red bouquets are the Spike proteins and the blue pastry-things are ribonucleoproteins.

Just to be clear, I was not involved in this work, I just downloaded the publicly available data
(the subtomogram averaging reconstruction) and made this image which you can use for free.
