I may have sent you this to this post. It's because I am bored of typing out basically the same message every
week for the last several years.

What I want to know is:

- Which version of Coot are you using?
- Which OS are you using?
- Where did you get your Coot? (I don't support CCP4 binaries)
- What did you click/press?
- What did you see? What does it say in the terminal? A screen-shot or two is often helpful.
- What did you expect to see?

And most importantly of all, you should ask yourself "have a reported this in a way that 
make it easy (or at least possible) for Paul to reproduce?"
